## Source Control Integration

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| GitHub repository connection | Repository connected to AWS services | Took about 1.5 hours; working end-to-end workflow where changes made on EC2-hosted project were committed locally and pushed to GitHub with traceable history | 02-source-control-github.md |
| Git installation | Git installed on EC2 instance | Git installed using sudo dnf install git -y | 02-source-control-github.md |
| Local repository initialization | Local repository initialized | git init initializes the local repository by creating the .git directory | 02-source-control-github.md |
| Authentication | Token-based authentication works | GitHub rejected password-based HTTPS pushes; secure authentication completed | 02-source-control-github.md |

---

## Infrastructure as Code

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| CloudFormation stack creation | Infrastructure provisioned via CloudFormation | The final template successfully deployed the defined CI/CD infrastructure; the CloudFormation template was generated by reverse-engineering the existing environment and translating resources into declarative definitions; the outcome is a reusable blueprint that provisions compute, identity, storage, and pipeline components in a controlled order | 04-infrastructure-cloudformation.md |
| Stack updates | Stack updates work correctly | Template corrections included fixing resource definitions, aligning parameters, and adding missing properties; explicit dependencies were added for CodeArtifact policies, CodeBuild projects, CodeDeploy deployment groups, and supporting S3 buckets to ensure prerequisite resources were available at creation time | 04-infrastructure-cloudformation.md |
| Infrastructure validation | Infrastructure matches defined configuration | The template was reviewed for syntax accuracy and completeness before deployment; successful deployment validated that the CI/CD infrastructure could be expressed as a deterministic template suitable for repeatable provisioning; the resulting stack provides a clear, auditable blueprint for the environment | 04-infrastructure-cloudformation.md |

---

## Build Automation

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| CodeBuild project creation | Build project configured and functional | The build was completed within a short execution window | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| GitHub integration | CodeBuild connects to GitHub repository | GitHub Apps used to authenticate CodeBuild to the repository | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| Build execution | Builds execute successfully | The build was completed within a short execution window; builds execute in CodeBuild using an AWS-managed container image and a build specification file; the build stage is responsible for compiling code, running tests, and producing deployable artifacts | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| Buildspec validation | buildspec.yml defines build behavior correctly | Initial build failed because repository did not include a buildspec.yml file; file added and build succeeded; the build specification defines ordered phases including install, pre-build, build, and post-build | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| Automated testing | Tests execute during build | Committing these changes to GitHub triggered a new build, which executed the tests successfully and validated the CI system's ability to enforce automated checks; the build process was extended to include automated test execution covering authentication edge cases | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| Artifact storage | Artifacts stored in S3 | Build artifacts represent the outputs of the build process; in this implementation, the build produces application files and a JSON report that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket to provide durable, externally accessible build results; artifacts are packaged and uploaded to S3 to decouple build execution from downstream consumption | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |

---

## Package Management

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| CodeArtifact repository creation | Repository created for package storage | AWS CodeArtifact is used to store, cache, and serve software packages required by the application; the CodeArtifact domain groups related repositories under a shared security and permission model; the repository is configured with Maven Central as an upstream source | 06-package-management-codeartifact.md |
| Dependency resolution | Dependencies resolved through CodeArtifact | This project took approximately one hour; dependency resolution flow observed end to end, from Maven to CodeArtifact and upstream to Maven Central | 06-package-management-codeartifact.md |
| IAM authentication | Maven authenticates to CodeArtifact | Primary complexity was aligning IAM policies, roles, and instance profiles so Maven could authenticate to CodeArtifact without static credentials | 06-package-management-codeartifact.md |
| Upstream source configuration | Maven Central configured as upstream | Repository configured with Maven Central as an upstream source | 06-package-management-codeartifact.md |

---

## Idempotent Provisioning

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Terraform installation | Terraform installed and configured | Terraform is used as an Infrastructure as Code tool to define cloud resources declaratively; the Terraform workflow begins with initializing the working directory to download required providers and prepare local state handling; this step ensures Terraform can interact with AWS using the defined provider configuration | 07-idempotent-provisioning.md |
| S3 bucket creation | Bucket created via Terraform | The implementation was completed within a short execution window; S3 resources can be created and updated deterministically through Terraform; applying the Terraform configuration creates or updates the S3 bucket according to the declared state; Terraform reconciles the desired configuration with existing resources in the AWS account | 07-idempotent-provisioning.md |
| Terraform state management | State managed correctly | Basic state handling and resource reconciliation validated; the tool manages infrastructure state externally and reconciles declared configuration with actual cloud resources; this supports repeatability, version control, and predictable changes across environments | 07-idempotent-provisioning.md |
| Idempotent operations | Repeated applies produce no changes | A planning step is used to calculate proposed changes before execution; applying configuration changes updates the existing bucket without recreating it when possible; Terraform determines the minimum required changes based on state comparison | 07-idempotent-provisioning.md |

---

## Pipeline Orchestration

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| CodePipeline creation | Pipeline configured with stages | Pipeline configured to execute automatically on changes rather than manual release gates | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Source stage | Source stage monitors GitHub and emits artifacts | Source stage monitors GitHub for changes and emits versioned artifacts | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Build stage | Build stage executes CodeBuild | Build stage uses CodeBuild to compile, test, and package code | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Deploy stage | Deploy stage uses CodeDeploy | Deploy stage uses CodeDeploy to apply validated artifacts to EC2 targets | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Pipeline execution | Pipeline executes end-to-end | Pipeline behavior was validated by introducing incremental code changes and observing automated execution across all stages | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Deployment validation | Deployment successful | Successful deployment was confirmed by verifying application changes on the running service, ensuring that pipeline outputs matched expected runtime behavior | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |
| Commit traceability | Commit metadata propagates through pipeline | Commit metadata propagated through the pipeline, providing traceability from source to deployment | 08-guardrail-enforcement.md |

---

## Rollback Procedures

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Deployment failure handling | System handles deployment failures | A deployment failure was intentionally triggered by introducing an invalid Maven repository configuration | 09-rollback-procedure.md |
| Automatic rollback | System reverts to previous version on failure | CodeDeploy supports automatic rollback when deployments fail health checks. In this case, the system reverted to the previously deployed version, limiting service disruption | 09-rollback-procedure.md |
| Rollback validation | Rollback behavior tested and confirmed | Rollback behavior was tested by initiating a deployment failure and observing automatic reversion to a known-good version | 09-rollback-procedure.md |
| Manual recovery | Manual redeployment possible | Recovery may also require manual redeployment of a known-good revision | 09-rollback-procedure.md |

---

## Negative Testing Summary

| Scenario | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Missing buildspec.yml | Build fails | Initial build failed because the repository did not include a buildspec.yml file | 05-build-automation-codebuild.md |
| Invalid Maven configuration | Deployment fails | A deployment failure was intentionally triggered by introducing an invalid Maven repository configuration | 09-rollback-procedure.md |
| Password-based authentication | GitHub rejects password auth | GitHub rejected password-based HTTPS pushes | 02-source-control-github.md |
