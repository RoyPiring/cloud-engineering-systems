# Stale Code Handling (Execution 04)

**Status:** Placeholder. Scope and behavior for stale-code handling are defined in [implementation.md](../implementation.md) and [validation.md](../validation.md). Full execution content will be added when the execution is implemented and validated.

This file preserves the execution structure and prevents broken references from the implementation execution path and validation evidence map.
